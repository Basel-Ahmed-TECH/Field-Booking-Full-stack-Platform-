# User Profile System - Football Booking Platform

This guide explains how to use the new user profile system that has been added to your football booking platform.

## ðŸŽ¯ What's Been Added

### 1. User Profile Page (`/profile.html`)
A comprehensive user profile page that displays:
- **User Information**: Name, email, phone number, role
- **Account Details**: Member since date, total bookings, account status
- **Booking History**: All user bookings displayed as beautiful cards with:
  - Field name and location
  - Booking dates and times
  - Booking status (upcoming/completed)
  - Deposit payment status
  - Booking ID

### 2. Authentication System
- **Login Page** (`/login.html`): Secure user authentication
- **Protected Routes**: Profile page requires authentication
- **Token Management**: JWT-based authentication with auto-redirect

### 3. Enhanced Backend
- **User Profile Endpoint**: `GET /api/users/profile` - Returns current user data
- **Phone Number Field**: Added to User model with validation
- **Static File Serving**: Express now serves HTML files from `public/` directory
